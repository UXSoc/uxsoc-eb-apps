            <h2>The User Experience Ambassador</h2>
            <p>
              The VP for Externals has the responsibility of being the face of
              the organization and ensuring a good rapport to our dear
              partners and sponsors, both long-term and short-term. The VP
              works closely with departments that have major events and
              projects.
            </p>
            <p>
              This includes preparing sponsorship & media partnership
              packages, emailing partners, assuring fulfillment of terms in
              partnerships, and settling MOAs with the organization or
              corporation partners in person.
            </p>
            <p>
              He/she should have prior experience in the creation of MoAs, as
              well as sponsorship and partnership packages. The VP should also
              create a system to efficiently track the partnerships and
              sponsorships ongoing for the organization, and foster the
              development and skillsets of the AVPs of Sponsorships and
              Partnerships.
